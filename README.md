PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ frontend. Furthermore, Uber's Pyro probabilistic programming language software uses PyTorch as a backend

PyTorch provides two high-level features:

1. Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
2. Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
